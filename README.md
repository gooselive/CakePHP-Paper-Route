###CakePHP Paper Route Maintenance

My attempt at duplicating the route card functionality found at [mydistrict.net](https://www.mydistrict.net/home/). It is currently hosted on 000freewebhost at [gooselive.net23.net](http://gooselive.net23.net).

#### To Do

* Add unit and integration tests for the existing code base
* Add authorization and access control
* Add Carrier Expenses model
* Add additional style elements and customize the css
* refactor the route maintenance forms to make them dynamic. The desired end result would be a form which allows route directions and addresses to be displayed in the form as on the generate route card and moved around by a drag and drop method to change the route.
